Material for Creating Data Products Course Final Project

The ML features which are used as the inputs for the Shiny app
come from various tests students take either during their course of study
or as part of the intake procedure.  Both students and instructors, the
intended audience for this app, are familiar with all of the terminology.  

This is a simulation only as the real app will use actual student data and
is therefore private.  To provide interactivity and visual interest for the
assignment I created an equation that calculates a score based on the inputs.
This calculation is a rough estimate of the real action in the final prediction
product with the histogram (run from the Test Pack score) acting as a 
place holder for a yet to be defined graph of performance.

Within the slides there is a graph of the mtcars data acting as a 
placeholder for the eventual insertion of real data into the slide.
