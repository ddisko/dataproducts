Statement of Problem
========================================================

Adult Learners seeking a GED or similar High School Equivalency (HSE)
certificate need to progress through their course of study as quickly
as possible but be truly ready to take the expensive, high-stakes exam.

Adult Learners have: 
- A Variety of Adaptive Assessemments that Prescribe Lessons
- Initial (mandated) Assessements During Intake
- Access to Their Own Data

Further
========================================================

- To be Sucessful They Need to Feel Ownership of the Process
- Grades are not Assigned in a Traditional Sense
- Readiness to Pass the Exam is Key and Completion of a Course is Not Required
- Adult Learners Need a Tool to Help Them Measure Readiness Beyond "Just Data Reports"

Large Data Set Available from over 30,000 Students
========================================================

Note:For reasons of privacy this is not actual student data.
